# Use Cases

Let's look at a few example real-world use cases of Ocean Mind in action. 

## Executive Level - Department of Energy (DOE) Official

Let's say a DOE official, Jane, is creating an executive summary of the [Offshore Wind Centers of Excellence program](https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/articles/funding-notice-offshore-wind-centers-excellence). Jane would be required to answer questions related to the following areas:

1. Center Description, Innovation, and Impact (Approximately 30% of the Technical Volume)

This includes relevance and outcomes, feasibility, and innovation and impacts. The official should provide a detailed description of the Center, including the technological and regional offshore wind challenges that will be addressed through the Center. They should also demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed Center and their capability to achieve the anticipated performance targets. The current state-of-the-art in the applicable research scope proposed for the Center, the advantages offered by establishing a Center of Excellence with their chosen specialization and/or region, a justification of how well their proposed research scope fits DOE priorities, and the overall impact on advancing regional and/or national development and deployment of offshore wind energy if the Center is successful should also be described

2. Workplan (Approximately 40% of the Technical Volume)

This includes a summary of the Center Objectives, Technical Scope, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Milestones, and Project Schedule. The Workplan should contain information about the goals and objectives of the Center, the overall work scope and approach to achieve the objectives, the work to be accomplished, and how the applicant will achieve the milestones and financial sustainability, and produce all deliverables. 

### Process

Let's say Jane wants to answer the question "What are the key technological and regional offshore wind challenges that our project is addressing?"

1. *Query Input:* Jane types her question into the Ocean Mind platform: "What are the key technological and regional offshore wind challenges that our project is addressing?"

2. *Data Retrieval:* Ocean Mind's tool searches the vector data lake, which contains all the relevant data from various sources. This includes project reports, research papers, meeting minutes, and other documents related to the offshore wind project.

3. *Information Extraction:* The results of the vector search with sources produces documents and extracts the relevant information. It identifies sections of the documents that discuss the technological and regional challenges that the project is addressing.

4. *Answer Generation:* The results of the vector search are then used to prompt a LLM with the project specific information to generate a concise summary of the key challenges. This could include things like the need for more efficient wind turbines, the impact of weather conditions on wind energy production, and the need to balance energy production with environmental conservation.

5. *Presentation of Information:* The answer is presented to Jane in a user-friendly format. It's written in plain English and organized in a way that makes it easy for Jane to understand and communicate to others. In addition to an answer to her question, the documents that were used in generating the answer will also be referenced in the answer so that she can point to definitive sources. This prevents some of the risks associated with LLM hallucinations. 

5. *Further Exploration:* If Jane needs more detailed information, she can ask follow-up questions. 

By using Ocean Mind, Jane can quickly and easily get the information she needs without having to sift through numerous documents and databases. This not only saves her time but also ensures that the information she's getting is accurate and up-to-date.
