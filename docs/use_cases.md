# Use Cases

Let's look at a few example real-world use cases of Ocean Mind in action. 

## Executive Level - Department of Energy (DOE) Official

Let's say a DOE official, Dr. Jane Blum, is creating an executive summary of the [Offshore Wind Centers of Excellence program](https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/articles/funding-notice-offshore-wind-centers-excellence). Jane would be required to answer questions related to the following areas:

1. Center Description, Innovation, and Impact (Approximately 30% of the Technical Volume)

This includes relevance and outcomes, feasibility, and innovation and impacts. The official should provide a detailed description of the Center, including the technological and regional offshore wind challenges that will be addressed through the Center. They should also demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed Center and their capability to achieve the anticipated performance targets. The current state-of-the-art in the applicable research scope proposed for the Center, the advantages offered by establishing a Center of Excellence with their chosen specialization and/or region, a justification of how well their proposed research scope fits DOE priorities, and the overall impact on advancing regional and/or national development and deployment of offshore wind energy if the Center is successful should also be described

2. Workplan (Approximately 40% of the Technical Volume)

This includes a summary of the Center Objectives, Technical Scope, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Milestones, and Project Schedule. The Workplan should contain information about the goals and objectives of the Center, the overall work scope and approach to achieve the objectives, the work to be accomplished, and how the applicant will achieve the milestones and financial sustainability, and produce all deliverables. 

### Process

Let's say Jane wants to answer the question "What are the key technological and regional offshore wind challenges that our project is addressing?"

1. *Query Input:* Jane types her question into the Ocean Mind platform: "What are the key technological and regional offshore wind challenges that our project is addressing?"

2. *Data Retrieval:* Ocean Mind's tool searches the vector data lake, which contains all the relevant data from various sources. This includes project reports, research papers, meeting minutes, and other documents related to the offshore wind project.

3. *Information Extraction:* The results of the vector search with sources produces documents and extracts the relevant information. It identifies sections of the documents that discuss the technological and regional challenges that the project is addressing.

4. *Answer Generation:* The results of the vector search are then used to prompt a LLM with the project specific information to generate a concise summary of the key challenges. This could include things like the need for more efficient wind turbines, the impact of weather conditions on wind energy production, and the need to balance energy production with environmental conservation.

5. *Presentation of Information:* The answer is presented to Jane in a user-friendly format. It's written in plain English and organized in a way that makes it easy for Jane to understand and communicate to others. In addition to an answer to her question, the documents that were used in generating the answer will also be referenced in the answer so that she can point to definitive sources. This prevents some of the risks associated with LLM hallucinations. 

5. *Further Exploration:* If Jane needs more detailed information, she can ask follow-up questions. 

By using Ocean Mind, Jane can quickly and easily get the information she needs without having to sift through numerous documents and databases. This not only saves her time but also ensures that the information she's getting is accurate and up-to-date.

## Agency Level - NOAA Official

### Scenario

Consider a NOAA official, Mark, who is responsible for overseeing the environmental impact of various projects, including the offshore wind and offshore carbon capture project in Oregon. Mark needs to stay updated on the project's progress, understand its impacts, and ensure compliance with environmental regulations. However, the information he needs is scattered across various reports, databases, and websites. He spends a significant amount of time gathering and interpreting this data, which is not only inefficient but also leaves room for error.

### Solution - Ocean Mind

With Ocean Mind, Mark can get the information he needs quickly and accurately. He simply logs into the Ocean Mind platform and types in his question, such as "What is the current status of the offshore wind and carbon capture projects in Oregon?" or "What are the key environmental impacts of these projects?"

Ocean Mind's AI/LLM tool begins to search the data lake, which contains all the relevant data from various sources. This includes project reports, research papers, meeting minutes, and other documents related to the offshore wind and carbon capture projects.

The tool then generates a concise summary of the key challenges and impacts. This could include things like the need for more efficient wind turbines, the impact of weather conditions on wind energy production, and the need to balance energy production with environmental conservation.

### Benefits

With Ocean Mind, Mark can:

Save time by getting the information he needs quickly and easily.
Make informed decisions based on accurate and up-to-date information.
Easily share information with his superiors and other stakeholders.
Ensure compliance with environmental regulations by having access to the latest data and research.
Focus on strategic tasks instead of spending time gathering and interpreting data.

The platform would then show a visual representation of the data lake, with data being pulled from various sources. The final output would be a concise executive summary presented in a user-friendly format.

It would include a search bar for typing in questions, a section for displaying the executive summary, and options for customizing the level of detail. It could also include features like a dashboard for tracking the project's progress and a section for saving and sharing reports.

## Researcher - NANOOS

### Scenario

Meet Dr. Alex, a researcher at NANOOS, who is tasked with supporting the environmental assessment for an offshore wind and offshore carbon capture project. Dr. Alex is an expert in oceanography but is unsure about the best metrics to use for the environmental assessment of these specific projects. He needs to consider various factors, including the specific environmental characteristics of the project area, the potential impacts of the projects, and the requirements of the grants funding the projects.

### Solution - Ocean Mind

With Ocean Mind, Dr. Alex can get the information he needs to formulate valid environmental assessment metrics. He simply logs into the Ocean Mind platform and types in his question, such as "What are the recommended environmental assessment metrics for offshore wind projects?" or "What are the specific environmental considerations for offshore carbon capture projects in the Pacific Northwest?"

Ocean Mind's AI/LLM tool searches the data lake, which contains all the relevant data from various sources, including academic publications, project reports, and metadata about the involved parties. The tool then provides a detailed answer, pulling data from the relevant sources and presenting it in a format that Dr. Alex can easily understand and apply to his work.

If Dr. Alex needs to customize these metrics based on the specific requirements of the grants funding the projects, he can ask Ocean Mind for help. For example, he could ask, "What are the environmental assessment requirements of the DOE grant for offshore wind projects?" The tool would provide a detailed answer, pulling information from the grant documents and other relevant sources.

### Benefits

With Ocean Mind, Dr. Alex can:

Access a vast amount of information from various sources in one place.
Get accurate and up-to-date information to support his work.
Save time by getting the information he needs quickly and easily.
Customize the information based on his specific needs and the requirements of the projects.
