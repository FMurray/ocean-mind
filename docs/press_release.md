# "GPT" In An Unlikely Place - Government Agencies

Branch chief Ana Hood is in a meeting room in NOAAs Silver Spring headquarters. The TV on the wall shows talking heads from around the country -- Dr. Jane Blum, Program Director for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and Dr. Alex Samoiliov from the University of Washington. The meeting is a Go/No-Go Review for a novel carbon capture project managed under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, a type of public-private partnership between the agencies and University. 

Jane asks "Where are we on Milestones?". Ana flashes a slight smile, "Let me just share my screen, can you all see that?", the talking heads nod. On the screen is something that looks like ChatGPT, but the URL and branding are NOAA. She types in "Please summarize the milestones for the project, showing status for each and showing if they are SMART", in an instant, words start streaming back: 

```
Sure, I can help summarize the milestones of the project. The Funding Opportunity Announcement states that milestons should be SMART -- Specific, Measureable, Assignable, and Timely. Here are the stated milestones in the project documentation:

1. Project Scope and Budget Completion
Status: Completed - GO
Specific: This milestone involves the creation and approval of project scope and budget under the terms of the grants and other sources of funding and project approval. 
Measurable: This is measured by the completion and approval of the relevant project documents
Attainable: The involved parties have the resources necessary to complete this milestone. 
Timely: This milestone began on June 20, 2023, and was completed on August 1, 2023. 


2. Envionmental Impact Assessment 
Status: Pending
Specific: This milestone should be tied to definitive metrics from an environmental impact assessment. The project documentation states that the research station and Agencies are still deliberating on the best way to perform the impact assessment

"How does ChatGPT know all of this?", Jane asks. "This is OceanMind, a new tool we have been using", says Ana. "We have uploaded all the project documents to OceanMind, and now we can have use AI to ask questions about our projects."

"Candidly, our researchers have been been challenged on time to create very specific metrics for the impact assessment here, could it help them?", Dr. Alex asks.

"Let's give it a shot!", Ana says, typing a follow up message responding to the first one. 

```
Ana: How can we make the Environmental Impact Assessment more specific and measurable? Include a few different ways we could perform the assessment.

OceanMind: You're right that the stated Objective isn't SMART. 

There are 7 stages of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): 
1. Project screening
2. Scope of the assessment
3. Collecting basic data
4. Indentification of the environmental impact
5. Comparing the imopacts of selected alternatives and determining their importance
6. Mitigating measures
7. Public consulation and participation

To make the objective more SMART, we can try a few things. 

Geologic Site Characterization: ...
Monitoring, Reporting and Verification Plan: ...
Surface Leakage Detection: ...
Establishing Baselines: ...
Mechanical Integrity tests: ...

"Wow, so OceanMind includes the sources it used to provide it's answer as well?", injects Dr. Alex. "Yes, we were initially concerned about the AI hallucinating, since we had heard so much that in the news, lawyers citing fictitious briefs, etc. We made sure that the system would be tuned to include guardrails for that. Including sources is one of those guardrails", Ana replies.

"This is very impressive, however I'm concerned that we won't be able to perform Surface Leakage Detection"

Instead of responding, Ana starts typing: 

```
Are there any possible resources in the area who can perform the surface leakage detection? Include both internal and external companies, as well as other researchers. 

Yes, there are a few companies and research groups in the OceanMind system, and externally who can perform surface leakage detection:

Internal resources:
- JEFCO. JEFCO specializes in this type of data collection and can also support the University researchers with data collection, literature review and more.

External resources:
- Oregon State University Pacific Marine Energy Center. PMEC has published several peer-reviewed articles on multiple facets of offshore energy research and impact assessment. They have focused on Tidal and Wave research, but the papers mention a few things that would help perform Surface Leakage Detection...
```

"I didn't know that Oregon State was doing this kind of work! It's remarkable that OceanMind can actually find relevant text in their publications and find ways that it could be useful. That would take us weeks of time to do otherwise.", says Dr. Alex.

"I must admit, I wasn't optimistic about giving a GO in this meeting", adds Dr. Jane, "But after seeing this, I think we just might make it. AI really might just help us avert a climate crisis! Do you think we could start using this at ARPA?"

The slight smile flashes back across Ana's face. "I'll see what we can do."
