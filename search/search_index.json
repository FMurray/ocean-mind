The data is spread across various organizational hierarchies (Department, Agency, Bureau) and across different formats, making it even more challenging to access and understand.</p> <p>Furthermore, we've identified that existing technologies like ElasticSearch, while powerful, may not be the most suitable for a government setting due to the need for dedicated engineers and maintainers.

For example if a research organization like NANOOS vectorizes their research papers, metadata, website content, etc. a question like \"who is producing data about waves in the Pacific Northwest?\" can be used to fetch some number of relevant documents from the vector store.

This eliminates the need to navigate through different databases or request data from other stakeholders, speeding up the process and ensuring everyone is working with the same information.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Improved Data Discoverability: The AI/LLM tool can help stakeholders find specific information quickly and easily. For example, a public stakeholder interested in the environmental impact of the project could ask the tool, \"What is the projected impact of the offshore wind project on marine life in Oregon?\" and receive a clear, concise answer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Customized Information: Different stakeholders have different levels of comprehension and need different types of information. The AI/LLM tool can provide customized information based on who is asking the question. For example, a researcher from NANOOS might need detailed data on oceanographic conditions, while a public stakeholder might need a simpler explanation of the project's impact, or a Departmental offical might need an executive summary to present to Congress. </p> </li> <li> <p>Efficient Resource Utilization: By leveraging AI/LLMs and Data Lakes, the need for dedicated technical resources to manage and interpret the data is significantly reduced. This not only lowers the total operating cost but also allows these resources to be utilized for other critical tasks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enhanced Collaboration: The proposed solution can enhance collaboration among stakeholders by providing a common platform for data access and interpretation. This can lead to better decision-making and more successful project implementation. Instead of requiring long back and forth email chains, question answering and collaboration can be expedited by LLM-backed workflows, accelerating the project's time to success.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compliance with Government Policies: The solution is designed to operate within a government setting and complies with all relevant rules and policies. This ensures that all data handling and interpretation are done in a legally compliant manner. Additionally, the LLM can answer questions (with sources) about government policies and how to comply with them. </p> </li> <li> <p>Scalability: The proposed solution is scalable and can handle an increasing amount of data as the project progresses. This ensures that the tool remains useful and efficient throughout the project's lifecycle. Stakeholder specific Data repositories like DOE, or NOAA repositories can be re-used across projects. </p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"press_release/","title":"\"GPT\" In An Unlikely Place - Government Agencies","text":"<p>Branch chief Ana Hood is in a meeting room in NOAAs Silver Spring headquarters. The TV on the wall shows talking heads from around the country -- Dr. Jane Blum, Program Director for the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and Dr. Alex Samoiliov from the University of Washington. The meeting is a Go/No-Go Review for a novel carbon capture project managed under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, a type of public-private partnership between the agencies and University. </p> <p>Jane asks \"Where are we on Milestones?\". Ana flashes a slight smile, \"Let me just share my screen, can you all see that?\", the talking heads nod. On the screen is something that looks like ChatGPT, but the URL and branding are NOAA. She types in \"Please summarize the milestones for the project, showing status for each and showing if they are SMART\", in an instant, words start streaming back: </p> <pre><code>Sure, I can help summarize the milestones of the project. The Funding Opportunity Announcement states that milestons should be SMART -- Specific, Measureable, Assignable, and Timely. Here are the stated milestones in the project documentation:\n\n1. Project Scope and Budget Completion\nStatus: Completed - GO\nSpecific: This milestone involves the creation and approval of project scope and budget under the terms of the grants and other sources of funding and project approval. \nMeasurable: This is measured by the completion and approval of the relevant project documents\nAttainable: The involved parties have the resources necessary to complete this milestone. \nTimely: This milestone began on June 20, 2023, and was completed on August 1, 2023. \n\n\n2.

Include a few different ways we could perform the assessment.\n\nOceanMind: You're right that the stated Objective isn't SMART. \n\nThere are 7 stages of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): \n1. Project screening\n2. Scope of the assessment\n3. Collecting basic data\n4. Indentification of the environmental impact\n5. Comparing the imopacts of selected alternatives and determining their importance\n6. Mitigating measures\n7. Public consulation and participation\n\nTo make the objective more SMART, we can try a few things. \n\nGeologic Site Characterization: ...\nMonitoring, Reporting and Verification Plan: ...\nSurface Leakage Detection: ...\nEstablishing Baselines: ...\nMechanical Integrity tests: ...\n\nSources:\n- Environmental Impact Assessment - Necessity, Principles and Specificities (http://tru.uni-sz.bg/tsj/Vol.%2013,%202015,%20Suppl.%202,%20Series%20Biomedical%20Sciences/AF/AF/Students/M.Sabeva.pdf)\n- https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/uploadedFiles/BOEM/Oil_and_Gas_Energy_Program/Energy_Economics/External_Studies/OCS%20Sequestration%20Report.pdf\n</code></pre> <p>\"Wow, so OceanMind includes the sources it used to provide it's answer as well?\", injects Dr. Alex. \"Yes, we were initially concerned about the AI hallucinating, since we had heard so much that in the news, lawyers citing fictitious briefs, etc. We made sure that the system would be tuned to include guardrails for that. Including sources is one of those guardrails\", Ana replies.</p> <p>\"This is very impressive, however I'm concerned that we won't be able to perform Surface Leakage Detection\"</p> <p>Instead of responding, Ana starts typing: </p> <pre><code>Are there any possible resources in the area who can perform the surface leakage detection? Include both internal and external companies, as well as other researchers. \n\nYes, there are a few companies and research groups in the OceanMind system, and externally who can perform surface leakage detection:\n\nInternal resources:\n- JEFCO. JEFCO specializes in this type of data collection and can also support the University researchers with data collection, literature review and more.\n\nExternal resources:\n- Oregon State University Pacific Marine Energy Center. PMEC has published several peer-reviewed articles on multiple facets of offshore energy research and impact assessment. They have focused on Tidal and Wave research, but the papers mention a few things that would help perform Surface Leakage Detection...\n</code></pre> <p>\"I didn't know that Oregon State was doing this kind of work!
